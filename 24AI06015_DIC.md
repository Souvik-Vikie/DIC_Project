## 1. Map-Reduce Implementation for Most Visited Pages (Based on Age and Profession)

### Problem Statement
We have:
- A file containing user data (fields: name, age, profession).
- A log file with website visit information including timestamps and page URLs accessed by users.

The goal is to find the top 10 most visited pages by users aged 18-26 who are students.

### Map-Reduce Implementation

1. **Mapper Function**:
   - **Input**: The input consists of two files, requiring two mappers:
     - **Mapper 1**: Processes the user data file.
     - **Mapper 2**: Processes the web log data file.
   - **Processing**:
     - **Mapper 1** (User Data):
       - Emits key-value pairs only for users aged 18-26 and with the profession "student".
       - **Output**: `(user_id, "student")` for users who meet the age and profession criteria.
     - **Mapper 2** (Web Log Data):
       - Joins with Mapper 1 output to filter visits by eligible users.
       - **Output**: `(page_id, 1)` for each relevant page visit.
   
2. **Reducer Function**:
   - **Input**: Aggregated `(page_id, list_of_counts)` pairs.
   - **Processing**:
     - Summing counts for each `page_id` to get total visits.
     - Sorting all pages by count and selecting the top 10 most visited pages.
   - **Output**: A list of the top 10 most visited pages.

### Key-Value Pairs at Each Stage
- **Mapper 1 Output**: `(user_id, "student")`
- **Mapper 2 Output**: `(page_id, 1)`
- **Reducer Output**: `(page_id, total_visits)`

### Selection of Mappers and Reducers
- **Mappers**: Determined based on input size and split size to maximize data locality.
- **Reducers**: Using 1-3 reducers optimizes the load for aggregation without data skew.

### Performance Report
- **Execution Time**: The code performed well, achieving optimal execution time by utilizing two map-reduce stages.
- **Scalability**: The approach scaled efficiently, handling the data size without delays.
- **I/O Overhead**: Intermediate data was minimized through efficient filtering and joining operations.

## 2. Map-Reduce Implementation for Sum of Cubes of Odd, Even, and Prime Numbers

### Problem Statement
The input file contains positive integers (one per line), and the task is to calculate the sum of cubes for:
- Odd numbers
- Even numbers
- Prime numbers (considered odd by definition)

### Map-Reduce Implementation

1. **Mapper Function**:
   - **Input**: Each line contains an integer.
   - **Processing**:
     - Determines if the integer is even, odd, or prime.
     - Emits a separate key-value pair for each category:
       - **Odd**: `(odd, cube)`
       - **Even**: `(even, cube)`
       - **Prime**: `(prime, cube)` (if prime)
   - **Output**: A key-value pair `(category, cube_of_number)` for each integer.

2. **Reducer Function**:
   - **Input**: Aggregated `(category, list_of_cubes)` pairs.
   - **Processing**:
     - Summing cubes for each category (odd, even, and prime).
   - **Output**: `(category, total_sum_of_cubes)`

### Key-Value Pairs at Each Stage
- **Mapper Output**: `(odd/even/prime, cube_of_number)`
- **Reducer Output**: `(odd/even/prime, total_sum_of_cubes)`

### Performance Report
- **Execution Time**: Effective with data partitioning, handling large inputs efficiently.
- **Optimization**: Categorization in the mapper minimized intermediate data size, optimizing I/O.

## 3. Social Network Database Application Using Hive

### Problem Statement
The objective is to create a simple database to maintain user/group information in a social network using Hive, with various queries for data extraction.

### Implementation Using Hive

1. **Schema Definition**:
   - **Users Table**:
     - `user_id` (INT), `name` (STRING), `age` (INT), `gender` (STRING), `location` (STRING)
   - **Groups Table**:
     - `group_id` (INT), `group_name` (STRING), `description` (STRING)
   - **Membership Table**:
     - `user_id` (INT), `group_id` (INT)

2. **Sample Queries**:
   - **Query 1**: Find all users aged 18-25 who are in "Tech Enthusiasts" group.
     ```sql
     SELECT u.name
     FROM users u
     JOIN membership m ON u.user_id = m.user_id
     JOIN groups g ON m.group_id = g.group_id
     WHERE u.age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 AND g.group_name = 'Tech Enthusiasts';
     ```
   - **Query 2**: Get the count of members in each group.
     ```sql
     SELECT g.group_name, COUNT(m.user_id) AS member_count
     FROM groups g
     JOIN membership m ON g.group_id = m.group_id
     GROUP BY g.group_name;
     ```
   - **Query 3**: Find the total number of users in each location.
     ```sql
     SELECT location, COUNT(user_id) AS user_count
     FROM users
     GROUP BY location;
     ```

### Comparison of Hive and HBase
- **Hive**: Suitable for analytical queries and batch processing. Its SQL-like structure simplifies handling structured data in tables.
- **HBase**: Would provide faster read/write for real-time applications, making it better suited for high-frequency user interactions (e.g., messaging).
